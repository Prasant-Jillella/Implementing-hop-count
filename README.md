# Implementing-hop-count
Program that i developed for my professor to implement the hop count in c++
This program takes the various paths that are present in between source and destination and gives the least costly path as output.

This was implemented by my professor Mrs Shanti as part of a paper publication in ym under graduation at Gitam University.
